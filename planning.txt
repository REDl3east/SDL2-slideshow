A command line tool that displays a slideshow given input to images.

It will take many arguments:
- A directory of images
- A scale type
- A transition type
- A duration type
- Ping Pong, Repeat, etc

Navigation:
arrow keys
buttons that appear when mouse moves

Start simple

Input a directory and time each image is shown. Only support pngs for now
and image scales to a static screen size.

How should the images be loaded in?
A fixed sized image buffer that can load N images at a time. Another thread
handles the loading of images, maybe.
Right now just load one at a time.

features implemented:

dynamic image scaling
image navigation with right/left keys
